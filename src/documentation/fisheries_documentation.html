<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Decisions regarding conservation problems are complex because they deal with
interactions among people, their livelihoods, and natural resources. Moreover, decisions
may involve controversial or poorly understood issues such as the status of
species, equity, or property rights. Selecting a fishery that has the right set
of characteristics to be successful in the <a href="http://www.msc.org">Marine
Stewardship Council (MSC)</a> certification program may be even more complex. </p>

<p>Delphos: Fisheries is a decision-making tool for selecting suitable
candidate fisheries for MSC certification. It can be used to evaluate fisheries
anywhere in the world and in any size region. This program will guide you
through a data-gathering and analysis process that is compatible with your
institutional and project goals. </p>

<h1><a name=background>Background</a></h1>

<span style='mso-bookmark:background'></span>

<p>Through the application of an environmental standard for sustainable and
well-managed fisheries, the MSC seeks to harness consumer purchasing power to
generate change and promote environmentally responsible stewardship of the
world's fisheries. MSC certification not only provides long-term security for
fishing communities and the marine environment, but also offers fisheries an
opportunity to improve their management and advocate for better data
collection, new laws, and stronger enforcement measures. </p>

<p>The MSC is a standard-setting organization that has, with expert scientists
from around the world, developed certification criteria for well-managed and
sustainable fisheries. Each fishery that applies for MSC certification is
evaluated by the assessment team with regard to a standard set of principles
and criteria concerning 1) the health of the target species, 2) the effects of
the fishery on the ecosystem, and 3) the quality of the management system. For
details about the MSC standard, please see www.msc.org. </p>

<p>Early critics of the MSC contended that the certification process was geared
toward large-scale, industrial fisheries, and inaccessible to small-scale
community fisheries due to extensive data requirements and prohibitive costs.
However, many small-scale fisheries are healthy and well-managed. Small-scale
fisheries are also of enormous global importance, as small-scale fishers
comprise approximately 94% of the world's fishers and produce nearly half of
the global fish supply for human consumption. Small-scale fisheries provide
most of the protein and jobs for coastal communities around the world and
operate in some of the most biologically rich and diverse places on earth. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE>WWF's</span> <a
href="http://www.panda.org/marine/community_fisheries">Community Fisheries
Program</a> helps small-scale fisheries through the MSC certification process.
WWF has been working on small-scale fisheries certification since 1999,
emphasizing the participation of local fishers and the importance of
traditional knowledge in the certification process, and thereby engaging
communities in protecting the resources they rely upon. </p>

<h2>Program History</h2>

<p>In the spring of 2000, <a href="http://www.cobi.org.mx"><span class=SpellE>Comunidad</span>
y <span class=SpellE>Biodiversidad</span> A.C. (COBI)</a>, in partnership with
the WWF Community Fisheries Program, wondered how to select the best candidate
for MSC certification from dozens of fisheries on the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Baja California</st1:place></st1:State> peninsula. This software
program is based on the pre-analysis process that COBI and the Community
Fisheries Program conducted to select a suitable community fishery for
certification. </p>

<p>Because we needed to confront different institutional objectives from
various project partners, we designed a method to systematize our
decision-making process. By convening an expert panel to gather data and using
a <span class=SpellE>multicriteria</span> analysis process, we selected the <a
href="http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=12799&amp;uLangID=1">Baja
California red spiny lobster</a>, <span class=SpellE>Panulirus</span> <span
class=SpellE>interruptus</span>, as our preferred MSC candidate fishery. In
April 2004, this fishery became the first small-scale fishery from a developing
country to receive MSC certification. </p>

<p>Due to the success of this pilot project, COBI and the WWF Community
Fisheries Program have developed this versatile software program for selecting
suitable candidates for MSC certification. </p>

<h1><a name="multicriteria_analysis_evamix"></a><span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bookmark:multicriteria_analysis_evamix'>Multicriteria</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:multicriteria_analysis_evamix'> Analysis/<span
class=SpellE>Evamix</span></span></h1>

<span style='mso-bookmark:multicriteria_analysis_evamix'></span>

<p><span class=SpellE>Multicriteria</span> analysis is a versatile tool for
evaluating environmental and conservation questions. We selected <span
class=SpellE>multicriteria</span> analysis as the appropriate decision-making
tool to select candidates for MSC certification because it can handle both
qualitative and quantitative criteria and allows a question to be evaluated
from different points of view. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Multicriteria</span> analysis allows the inclusion of
both qualitative and quantitative information because it does not require
converting all data involved in the assessment to the same unit. This
flexibility allows one to include very vague criteria, such as the
&quot;community's current interest in MSC certification<span class=GramE>,.</span>”
as well as hard data, such as &quot;catch volume..” </p>

<p>Institutional or program goals may be expressed by weighting-or giving
importance to-certain criteria. The data can then be analyzed multiple times
from the perspectives of various project partners. For example, one partner may
wish to work with a fishery in a community that is actively involved in the management
system, while another partner finds it more important that the fishery has
strong national and international markets. Using <span class=SpellE>multicriteria</span>
analysis, partners may assign importance to each criterion as determined by
their individual goals, and the fisheries can be evaluated from each point of
view. The results from each analysis provide the basis for discussion among
project partners about which fishery to select for the MSC certification
process. </p>

<p>The <span class=SpellE>multicriteria</span> approach used in Delphos is the <span
class=SpellE>Evamix</span> method, a matrix-based evaluation and ranking tool.
The <span class=SpellE>Evamix</span> algorithm results in a relative ranking of
each fishery that incorporates all of the criteria and criteria weights. <span
class=SpellE>Evamix</span> is an ideal tool for our purposes of analyzing and
comparing fisheries because it is simple and flexible, and allows the user to
clearly define both qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>The following pages will step you through the pre-analysis process: project
planning, information gathering, and the use of the <span class=SpellE>multicriteria</span>
analysis program, Delphos. Each link in the chain depends, to an extent, on the
one before. As such, it is important to think through the entire process before
jumping into the project. Brainstorming the outcome of each step in advance
will help ensure that you gain the most from each step. </p>

<p>The pre-analysis is meant to give you a better understanding of the
fisheries that exist in a given geographical area and whether or not they are
good candidates for MSC certification. This method is not meant to reveal
larger political or cultural issues related to fisheries. While you can learn
about some of these issues through discussions with local experts, it is
imperative to be aware of the political realities of the region in question
before you begin and incorporate them into your project goals and design. </p>

<a href="#8_run_analysis">8. Run the Analysis</a> </p>

<h2>1. Define Your Goals</h2>

<p><a name="1_define_your_goals"></a>There are a number of reasons why an
organization might want to explore MSC certification for fisheries in a given
region. Alternatively, a group might want to use the pre-analysis process not
with MSC certification in mind, but simply to create a database of information
related to fisheries in a given region. </p>

<p>Your reasons for using this program will impact the way you approach the
pre-analysis process, from how you define the geographic region to the weights
you apply to criteria. Having a clear understanding from the beginning of what
you seek to accomplish will make the entire process flow more smoothly and
produce more meaningful and applicable results. </p>

<h2>2. Define Your Timeline</h2>

<p><a name="2_define_your_timeline"></a>It is important to consider the
timeline for your project as part of your initial brainstorming and project
design. In addition to considering your intended outcome, it is helpful to
think about how much time you want to spend on each step of the process.
Defining a timeline will help you avoid taking on too much. </p>

<p>For example, if you want to see results within one year, it would be unwise
to look at a very large region that includes a lot of fisheries. On the other
hand, if you are interested in a large region, it is important to realize that
your timeline may be closer to two years. In addition to the time needed to run
the pre-analysis, you might also want to consider the time needed to complete
goals beyond this point, such as MSC assessment or certification of the
selected fishery. Depending on the size and complexity of the fishery, the
actual certification process can become quite lengthy. Thinking through this
step will help refine expectations. </p>

<h2>3. Define the Region</h2>

<p><a name="3_define_the_region"></a>This model can be used anywhere in the
world and in any size region. However, the selection and definition of a region
is a critical part of both the pre-analysis and MSC certification. It is
important to keep in mind that the certification process can often be long and
challenging. While conducting a pre-analysis can help avoid some of the
obstacles associated with this kind of work, trying to tackle too large a
region will create additional difficulties. It is critical that the realities
of your financial and human resources agree with the realities of the region
that you choose to work in. </p>

<p>If you are considering a very large region, it is beneficial to
compartmentalize the project. You could do this based on management components,
as may be the case in a multi-state country, or by biological components, such
as habitats. By dividing the region in this way, you will essentially be
dealing with a number of mini-projects as opposed to one very large project.
Alternatively, consider partnering with other organizations throughout the
region that can locally execute the following chain of steps. </p>

<p>In addition to considerations of size, it is important to consider your
reasons for deciding to work in a given area. If conservation of an area is
your main purpose and MSC certification is only one element of the conservation
plan, then biological importance may be your driving force for site selection.
While this makes sense for conservation purposes, good fishery candidates that
do not lie directly in an area of biological importance can easily be
overlooked. If fisheries sustainability or sustainable resource development is
your driving force, then it might be beneficial to consider a larger area. The
importance of working in a biologically important location can still be
considered down the line as part of the criteria for selecting a candidate
fishery, and can be weighted accordingly. This approach will safeguard against
limiting your options from the beginning. </p>

<h2>4. Identify Experts</h2>

<p><a name="4_identify_experts"></a>Now that you have done some planning and
set the goals and geographical boundaries of your project, it is time to start
looking for candidate fisheries. There may be hundreds of active fisheries in
your selected region. In addition, these fisheries can likely be described by a
broad range of characteristics, ranging from coastal to oceanic, <span
class=SpellE>artisanal</span> to industrial, and community-based to
government-managed. So, how do you narrow the field? How do you start to determine
which fisheries meet the goals of your project? </p>

<p>Don't try to do it alone! </p>

<p>The first step is to identify a panel of experts that can help provide
fisheries information and guidance. The panel should be composed of a wide
range of experts, giving you the most comprehensive picture of fisheries in
your area. You might include several types of experts: academics, research
scientists, fishery managers, government officials, staff of non-profits or
NGOs, fishers, and others that work in the fishing industry. You can add
additional types of experts if you feel their knowledge and opinions will add
to the process. The inclusion of a variety of experts can also help you spread
the word about the MSC and your organization's goals in the region-a bit of
additional outreach that will help the process run more smoothly later on. </p>

<p>Also consider the culture of the region you are working in when deciding on
your approach to data-gathering and the types of experts to include in your
panel. Working in some locations may require creative tactics to obtain the
cooperation of various stakeholders. </p>

<p><a href="qrc://doc/fisheries_examples_from_the_field.doc">Click here</a> for
a comparison of how the WWF Community Fisheries Program outlined the first four
steps in the pre-analysis process in three very different scenarios. </p>

<h2>5. Consult the Experts</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="5_consult_the_experts"></a>Once you have identified
your panel of experts, you are ready to start asking for advice. It is
important that the experts are well informed about the MSC certification
process and the goals of your institution. Informing participants is critical
to obtaining the best information about fisheries in your region. </p>

<h3><a name="pre-analysis_workshop">Pre-Analysis Workshop</a></h3>

<p>Because the concept of <span class=SpellE>ecolabeling</span> and the MSC
process are complex and often best explained in person, the most effective way
to educate your panel is to bring them together at a workshop where you present
your project goals and the MSC program. This provides a framework with which
you can discuss appropriate candidate fisheries. </p>

<h3><a name="the_questionnaire">The Questionnaire</a></h3>

<p>Once you have well-informed experts, we recommend asking them to complete a
questionnaire as a way to gather information about potential candidate
fisheries. You can have the experts fill out questionnaires as individuals or
in groups at or after the workshop. </p>

<p>If a workshop is logistically or financially unfeasible, you can write a <a
href="qrc://doc/fisheries_letter_to_experts.doc">letter to the experts</a>
asking for their help. Be sure to provide the experts with a list of sources of
information (e.g. websites) where they can learn more about the MSC and your
organization. Also, remember that the experts might be very busy. If you do not
receive a response from them, follow up by phone or e-mail, and perhaps ask for
an appointment to interview them personally. </p>

<p>Three example questionnaires are provided. First is our <a
href="qrc://doc/fisheries_general_questionnaire.doc">general</a> questionnaire.
This questionnaire is very thorough, and we suggest that you adapt it to your
region and specific goals. For example, although the majority of the
questionnaire remained similar, the WWF Community Fisheries Program modified
several questions to reflect a <a
href="qrc://doc/fisheries_data_driven_questionnaire.doc">data-driven</a>
culture in one region and <a
href="qrc://doc/fisheries_data_limited_questionnaire.doc">data-limited</a>
conditions in another. </p>

<h1>Review Recommendations</h1>

<p><a name="6_review_recommendations"></a>Once the experts have returned
completed questionnaires, you should complete a <a
href="qrc://doc/fisheries_profile.doc">fishery profile</a> for each of your
candidates. The profile is a way to compile all of the information that you
have collected into a comprehensive overview of each fishery. Feel free to
modify our example to capture the information you have gathered with your
questionnaires. You will use the fishery profiles later on to evaluate your
criteria in the software program. </p>

<p>It is extremely important that you enter accurate data into the software
program, especially for quantitative criteria, as the information will affect
your results. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you ground truth the
information you have collected. You might also need to seek out supplementary
information that was not provided. You could do this by meeting with potential
candidates to review the facts about their fishery and gage their interest in
MSC certification. Since MSC certification is voluntary and requires the
participation of the fishery, it is essential that your chosen candidate is
interested in engaging in the process. You could also consult other
stakeholders, published literature, or reliable online references such as <a
href="http://www.fishbase.org"><span class=SpellE>FishBase</span></a>. </p>

<p>After you have completed the fishery profiles and verified the information
received, you should review the experts' recommendations and determine if the
suggested fisheries fit with your institutional and project goals. Discuss the
candidates with your project partners. At this point, you may want to remove
one or more of the fisheries from consideration. However, if you would like to
end with a database of all of the information you have gathered, we suggest
narrowing the field of candidates at a later point in the process. </p>

<h1><a name="7_design_your_database">7. Design Your Database</a></h1>

<p>Now that you have selected and gathered sufficient information about your candidate
fisheries, it is time to begin your analysis. </p>

<p>Click <a href="qrc://app/create_project">here</a> to create a new project
and design your database. </p>

<h2><a name="define_alternatives">Define Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>Alternatives are fisheries. A default set of alternatives can be loaded during
project <span class=GramE>creation,</span> otherwise you will be presented with
an empty alternative table. Use the &quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot;
buttons to populate and edit the list of alternatives to use in your analysis.
Once you are finished move on by selecting the &quot;criteria&quot; tab. </p>

<h2><a name="define_criteria">Define Criteria</a></h2>

<p>Criteria are specific standards that the software program will use to
evaluate the candidate fisheries from biological, management, political,
socioeconomic, and market perspectives. Criteria may reflect qualitative or
quantitative information. Qualitative criteria are assessed on an ordinal
scale, which must be clearly defined. </p>

<p>Over the course of a number of projects, we have developed a list of
suggested <a href="qrc://doc/fisheries_criteria_and_guidance.doc">criteria and
guidance</a> for their evaluation, which are built into the program. This list
reflects lessons we have learned and covers the most important areas to
consider when selecting a successful small-scale fishery to guide through the
MSC certification process. However, feel free to add, delete, or modify the
criteria based on your specific project goals and location. Also, keep in mind
that you are not required <span class=GramE>to use</span> all of the criteria
in your analysis-use this stage as a way to create a complete database of all
of the information you have collected. </p>

<p>After you have made any changes using the &quot;add&quot; and
&quot;remove&quot; buttons, click &quot;proceed&quot; to display your criteria
down the first column of your database. </p>

<h1><a name="8_run_analysis">8. Run Analysis</a></h1>

<p>Once you have defined your alternatives and <span class=SpellE>critera</span>
you can perform <span class=SpellE>multicriteria</span> analysis (MCA). To do
this, select the &quot;Run Analysis&quot; tab within your project window. The
analysis dialog allows you to view previous analysis runs and begin new ones.
To begin a new analysis run enter a name and description for this run in the
appropriate field and select the &quot;Start Analysis&quot; button. </p>

<h2><a name="select_alternatives">Select Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>At this point you will have a good sense of which fisheries to include in
the evaluation process. Select the fisheries you want to evaluate by clicking
the appropriate checkboxes in the first column of the table. We recommend
selecting no less than 3 fisheries. You must use the same list of criteria for
all fisheries under comparison. </p>

<p>Select the &quot;Next&quot; button to move on to the next step (Selecting
Criteria) </p>

<h2><a name="select_criteria">Select Criteria</a></h2>

<p>Select the criteria you want to evaluate by clicking the appropriate
checkboxes in the first column of the table. We recommend keeping the upper
limit to between 10-15 alternatives. </p>

<p>You will likely find that you lack enough information to complete every
cell. However, it is essential that you evaluate all of the selected criteria
for each fishery that you want to compare, as the program cannot evaluate
fisheries with gaps in information. </p>

<p>To fill these gaps you will want to consult your panel of experts again. By
relying on the experts for information, you ensure a robust evaluation. You may
want to invite them to a workshop aimed at filling information gaps, where you
divide them into small groups and ask the groups to assess each fishery against
each criterion. This will facilitate discussion, creating a better flow of
information and resulting in a more complete data set. If you are unable to
have a workshop and must send the experts the evaluation table, you will need
to average their opinions when the tables are returned. You could also again
consult other stakeholders, published literature, or reliable online references
such as <a href="http://www.fishbase.org"><span class=SpellE>FishBase</span></a>.
If you still cannot address some of the criteria, then those criteria with data
gaps must be dropped from the analysis. </p>

<p>Select the &quot;Next&quot; button to move on to the next step (Inputting
data) </p>

<h2><a name="input_data">Input Data</a></h2>

<p>A table is shown where the fisheries you selected form the columns and the
criteria you selected form the rows. When you click on cells associated with
qualitative criteria, the responses that are built into the program (or, if you
added criteria, that you previously defined) are displayed. Using your
completed fishery profiles, select the appropriate response for each fishery.
You will need to manually enter quantitative information. </p>

<p>Select the &quot;Next&quot; button to move on to the next step (Weighting
Criteria) </p>

<h2><a name="weight_criteria">Weight Criteria</a></h2>

<p>Once the evaluation table is complete and you are satisfied with the robustness
of the information, you are ready to weight the criteria. As we discussed at
the beginning, different partners in the project may have different goals.
Weighting the criteria allows project partners to decide which criteria are
most important given their differing viewpoints. </p>

<p>For example, say you are planning a vacation, and have narrowed your
potential destinations to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region>,
<st1:State w:st="on">Alaska</st1:State>, and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Your choice will differ
depending on the importance of various criteria such as weather, activities, and
cost. If you dream of lying on a warm, sandy beach, you would prefer <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
over <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alaska</st1:place></st1:State>.
If cost is then important, and visiting <st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region>
would be less expensive than traveling to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>,
you might choose to go to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
If cost is not as important to you as the availability of local wines, you
would prefer <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
On the other hand, if weather is not important to you and you really want to
see wildlife, you might pick <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alaska</st1:place></st1:State>.
Your decision will vary based on how much weight you place on your criteria,
just as in this program. </p>

<p>Criteria must be weighted on an ordinal scale of 1-5, where 1 is very
important and 5 is not at all important. Keep in mind that criteria weights
have a large impact on the final result. </p>

<p>You may first want to have each partner weight the criteria independently.
This will provide a basis for discussion. You can also run the model using an
average of each partner's weights, as well as equal weights for all criteria. </p>

<p>Select the &quot;Next&quot; button to move on to the next step (Running the
Analysis) </p>

<h2><a name="run_the_program">Run the Program</a></h2>

<p>At this point you are ready to run the model. Select the &quot;Run
Analysis&quot; button. Once completed a <span class=SpellE>summar</span> of the
result will be shown. </p>

<p>You can run the model multiple times with differently weighted criteria, and
thus evaluate the fisheries based on the different scenarios, goals, and
viewpoints of your project partners. The ability for multiple analyses also
allows you to compare different groups of fisheries. For example, if you have
fisheries from different countries in your dataset, you might want to compare
fisheries in one country at a time. In this case, you might run the program a
number of times using differently weighted criteria for each of your groups of
fisheries. </p>

<h1><a name="evaluating_your_results">Evaluating Your Results</a></h1>

<p>Each evaluation will produce a ranking of the fisheries you have analyzed,
which you may visualize graphically. At this point you will want to bring the
project partners together to discuss any differences in rankings, what might be
causing the changes, and how to best select your top candidate to enter the MSC
assessment process. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the quality of your results is only as good as the quality
of your data, and that the rankings are based on <span class=SpellE>pairwise</span>
comparisons. Thus, your highest-ranked fishery is not necessarily certain to
meet all of the MSC Principles and Criteria. </p>

<p>Analysis runs are stored in your project database and can be viewed from the
&quot;Analysis&quot; tab in the project window. Simply select a run from the
&quot;previous analysis&quot; table and select the &quot;View analysis results&quot;
button. Multiple results can be opened at one time and viewed alongside one
another allowing you to review the different rankings with your partners and
select the best candidate for MSC certification. </p>

<h1><a name="next_steps">Next Steps</a></h1>

<p>You have by this time built a support system of partners, colleagues, and
stakeholders who helped you with this evaluation process. They would very much
appreciate a report on your experiences as well as your final decision, with
which you may want to include a note thanking them for their help. </p>

<p>You will also want to communicate your selection back to the stakeholders of
the fishery you selected, as they will be excited to hear about the results of
your analysis. Once you have re-confirmed the fishery's interest, contact the
WWF Community Fisheries Program and/or the MSC for assistance entering the
pre-assessment process. </p>

<h1><a name=conclusion>Conclusion</a></h1>

<p>Delphos is a step-by-step process designed to help you select a good
community-based fishery candidate for MSC certification. As with any method,
you should modify it to suit your needs. If you have any suggestions or
feedback on either the pre-analysis method or the software program, please do
not hesitate to contact us-your advice is more than welcome. </p>
